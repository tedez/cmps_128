Honestly, we all worked on this pretty damn evenly the whole time.  We met up
almost every day at the same place to get this project done.  We utilized a lot
of pair programming with even "driving" time, as it was pretty necessary to
maintain our sanity.  But for real this project was super fun and challenging
and we all had a really great time working on it.
